# bench_time

This role measures the start and distance times of containers with different container runtimes using the time tool. 

The images have to be created or pulled with the role create_benchmark_images first. The images are then archived and loaded in this role.

With the parameters in the defaults/main.yml the benchmark can be configured in many ways.
