# tasks file for bench_time.ressource_limit

# The following includes are necessary, because loops don't work with blocks
# So the tasks are nested in subtasks to create nested loops
#
# Nested Loops
# Ressource Limit - use bench_time__resource_limits and set bench_loop_target_reccource_limit
# Runtime - use bench_time__runtimes and set bench_loop_target_runtime  <- this file
# Container           - use bench_time__target_images and set bench_loop_target_image_name
# Number of instances - no varables set or used   
# repeat              - repeats the bechmark as long as bench_time__repeat and set bench_loop_repeat_number
# benchmark           - do the real benchmark
