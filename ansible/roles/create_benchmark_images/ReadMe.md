# create_benchmark_images

This role provides the container images required for the benchmark.

The Nabla sample images are built for the different systems and the images under create_benchmark_images__pullable_images are pulled by the docker hub.

The images are created or pulled and then archived and loaded in this role.

With the parameters in the defaults/main.yml the benchmark can be configured in many ways.
