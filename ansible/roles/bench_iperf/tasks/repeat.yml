# tasks file for bench_iperf.repeat

# The following includes are necessary, because loops don't work with blocks
# So the tasks are nested in subtasks to create nested loops
#
# Nested Loops
# Ressource Limit     - use bench_iperf__resource_limits and set bench_loop_target_reccource_limit
# Runtime            - use bench_iperf__runtimes and set bench_loop_target_runtime
# Container           - use bench_iperf__target_images and set bench_loop_target_image_name
# Number of instances - no varables set or used   
# repeat              - repeats the bechmark as long as bench_iperf__repeat and set bench_loop_repeat_number <- this file
# benchmark           - do the real benchmark
