# tasks file for apachebench.container

# The following includes are necessary, because loops don't work with blocks
# So the tasks are nested in subtasks to create nested loops
#
# Nested Loops
# Ressource Limit     - use apachebench__resource_limits and set bench_loop_target_reccource_limit
# Runtime            - use apachebench__runtimes and set bench_loop_target_runtime
# Container           - use apachebench__target_images and set bench_loop_target_image_name
# Number of instances - use apachebench__target_count and set bench_loop_target_image_count   <- this file  
# repeat              - repeats the bechmark as long as apachebench__repeat and set bench_loop_repeat_number
# benchmark           - do the real benchmark
