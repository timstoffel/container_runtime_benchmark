# bench_linpack

This role measures the processor performance of container runtimes with the Linpack benchmark. 

The images have to be created or pulled with the role create_benchmark_images first. The images are then archived and loaded in this role.

With the parameters in the defaults/main.yml the benchmark can be configured in many ways.
